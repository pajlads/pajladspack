This is a modpack for our Minecraft server. We use [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) for management of it.

## Installing

Use the zip or mrpack in your favourite launcher (whichever is supported). For MultiMc/PolyMc/Prism Launcher consider using [packwiz-installer](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/)
